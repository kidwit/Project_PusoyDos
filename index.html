        <h2>How to play:</h2>
        The main object of the game is to be the first player to shed all your cards. The 2 is the highest card, above the Ace card,  and 3 is the lowest. In this variation, suits are ranked from highest to lowest:Hearts,Diamonds,Clubs, and Spades. The round starts off with a player adding the first hand. Hands can range from a single, a pair, a three of a kind, four of a kind, and various 5 card poker hands(full house, straights, flush). Once the first hand is played, the next player must play a hand that ranks higher than the previously played, or there is the option for the player to pass. If there arenâ€™t any hands available to play, then the only option there is, is to pass. Should the occasion come that all other players have passed, then the player who played the most recent hand will be given the chance to play a new hand. 
        
        <p>Note to players:After a player has taken their turn, the next player may notice cards in their hand already selected, however these are simply the position of where the player before you has played from their hand, as you would be able to notice in person. Please double click these cards to deselect before you take your turn to prevent bugs appearing in the player hands.</p>    </nav>
